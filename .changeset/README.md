# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in the readme](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/README.md)

We use changesets to manage versioning and changelog generation for the PostHog iOS SDK.

## Adding a changeset

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

This will prompt you to select the type of version bump (patch, minor, major) and write a summary of the changes.

The changeset file will be created in this `.changeset/` directory and should be committed with your PR.
