# Getting started

The iOS SDK runs in iOS and other Apple platform apps.

To send your first event, add the package, then call `setup` once at app startup with your project token and host from your [project settings](https://app.posthog.com/project/settings).

After `setup`, PostHog captures app lifecycle events, such as `Application Opened`, by itself. Use `capture` for your own events.

## Install

Add the package with Swift Package Manager, `https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-ios.git`, or with CocoaPods:

```ruby
pod "PostHog"
```

## Initialize

Call `setup` once, as early as possible in app startup.

```swift
import PostHog

let config = PostHogConfig(projectToken: "<ph_project_token>", host: "<ph_client_api_host>")
PostHogSDK.shared.setup(config)
```

## Capture an event

```swift
PostHogSDK.shared.capture("button_clicked", properties: ["plan": "pro"])
```

Call `identify` to link events to a user:

```swift
PostHogSDK.shared.identify("user_123", userProperties: ["email": "max@example.com"])
```

## Shut down

Events are sent in batches. Call `flush()` to send queued events now, or `close()` to shut the SDK down.

```swift
PostHogSDK.shared.close()
```
