# HYBRID RUNNER ARCHITECTURE
# The iOS adapter runs NATIVELY on macOS (not in Docker) because:
# 1. iOS SDK requires Darwin frameworks (SystemConfiguration, Foundation, etc.)
# 2. Docker only supports Linux containers, not macOS
# 3. GitHub Actions uses macos-latest runners for iOS builds
#
# To run tests:
# 1. Start the adapter on macOS host:
#    cd ~/work/posthog-ios/sdk_compliance_adapter
#    swift run
# 2. Run this docker-compose (test harness connects to host):
#    docker-compose up --abort-on-container-exit
